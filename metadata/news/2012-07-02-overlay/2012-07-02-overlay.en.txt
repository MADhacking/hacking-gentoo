The Hacking Networked Solutions overlay for Gentoo Linux may be used
in two modes.  

Mode One - Augment:

This mode should be employed by users who simply wish to utilise the
additional packages provided by this overlay.  No additional action is
required to use the hacking-gentoo overlay in this mode.  Any package
which is NOT a replacement for an "in tree" package is available.  Any
package which IS a replacement for an "in tree" package is masked.

Mode Two - Replace:

This mode should be employed by users who wish to utilise the
additional packages provided by this overlay AND who wish to ALWAYS use
the hacking-gentoo replacements for certain "in tree" packages.  Users
who wish to employ this mode should create symbolic links in their
/etc/portage/package.{mask,unmask} directories, as shown below.

ln -s ${OVERLAYS}/hacking-gentoo/masks/hacking-gentoo.package.mask \
    /etc/portage/package/mask/hacking-gentoo.package.mask
    
ln -s ${OVERLAYS}/hacking-gentoo/masks/hacking-gentoo.package.unmask \
    /etc/portage/package/unmask/hacking-gentoo.package.unmask
